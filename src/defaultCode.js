// Welcome to BIDE, the bookmarklet IDE. It compiles the JavaScript you type in
// this editor into ES5, minifies it, inserts it into an immediately invoked 
// function expression, and inserts that into the link in the top right corner 
// of the page. Drag either of the two bookmarklets to your bookmark bar to test 
// them out.
// 
// Be warned, whether or not the dev bookmarklet works depends on the CSP of the
// web page you are using it on. As such it is temperamental.
// 
// Your changes are automatically saved to the browser's local storage so you 
// can close the tab and come back to what you were doing later.

alert("Hello, world!");
